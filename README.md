# Proposal: Global Science Platform & Network
The goal is to not only empower scientists and citizen scientists but to break down the barrier between the two - allowing everyone to have access to the most powerful scientific platform & network that has ever been constructed. This will engage the broader community in the scientific process and foster an explosion of scientific discovery.
